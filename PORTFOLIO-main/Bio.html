                <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
                <p>My name is Bibin John Mathews, a passionate web developer and UI/UX designer based in London. With over 10 years of experience in the tech industry, I have worked on a wide range of projects, helping businesses develop intuitive and user-friendly digital solutions. I founded Firefly to provide customized web development and design services, offering both personal and commercial solutions.</p>
                <p>I specialize in creating responsive, aesthetically pleasing websites, with a focus on functionality, accessibility, and modern design trends. My journey began with a fascination for technology, which led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science. Over the years, I have worked with diverse clients, ranging from startups to established businesses, helping them create impactful digital experiences.</p>
                <p>When I’m not coding or designing, I enjoy mentoring aspiring developers and designers, staying updated on the latest industry trends, and occasionally writing about web technologies. As a freelancer, I’ve had the privilege to work on projects globally, providing tailor-made solutions that meet the unique needs of my clients.</p>
